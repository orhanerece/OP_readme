Introduction
============

The stellar occultation technique is a unique and reliable method to investigate the size, shape, and environment
around Solar System objects. One of the indispensables of this technique is multi-chord observations.
Sometimes collecting observational data and equipment details from observers affects prolonged research time.
For this reason, we aimed to create a common online platform where the needed data will be collected and analyzed
(producing light curves/photometry) on a single center for ongoing campaign observations.

Occultation Portal is a web-based astronomical archive and analysis platform for aiming the fast, efficient,
and centralized management of occultation observation campaigns called by the
`Lucky Star Project/Paris Observatory/LESIA`_
and the
`ACROSS Project`_. This platform is a scientific initiative conducted in partnership with a
`TÜBİTAK National Observatory (Turkey)`_, `Akdeniz University (Turkey)`_,
`The Federal University of Technology – Paraná (Brasil)`_, the
`Paris Observatory/LESIA Lucky Star Project (France)`_ and the
`Observatoire de la Côte d’Azur - Boulevard de l’Observatoire (France)`_.

| For detailed information about the Occultation Portal's software design and architecture, you can review the presentation at the `39th ESOP`_: `PDF`_ - `Video`_
